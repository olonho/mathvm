#summary Math VM language

= Introduction =

For purposes of this class we use simple curly-brace language, called MVM language.
It's semantics is natural C-like semantics with same operator precedence and such.

For example
{{{
int i;
i = 1;
print('Hello, i=', i);
}}}
will print
{{{
 Hello, i=1
}}}

For other constructs, you may consult samples in tests/*.mvm.
